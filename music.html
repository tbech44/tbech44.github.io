    One of the greatest features about the North Shore is Stage AE, one of the
    most popular music venues in the city.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stage AE is a combination indoor/outdoor venue that can fit 2,400 indoors
    and 5,550 outside.  It cost $12 million to construct.  It is mostly used for conerts.  Interestingly
    enough, the first concert in the venue was Girl Talk, who is actually a
    Pittsburgh native.  Other notable local acts that have performed here include
    Wiz Khalifa, the Clarks, and Mac Miller.

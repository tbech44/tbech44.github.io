    The North Shore is an area rich in cultural history that serves as a host for
    a plethora of events.  The area is home to a diverse mix of attractions.
    It is the athletic hub of the city, containing both Heinz Field and PNC Park.
    Stage AE is arguably the most popular concert venue within city limits.
    For those with more academic interests, the North Shore is also home to the
    Carnegie Science Center.
    Each of these venues serves a vital function in the city and helps
    to make the North Shore an essential part of Pittsburgh.
